# just a status line

it's just a status line. what more do you want? (wip btw xd ðŸ¤ª)

## gimme

using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) (or whatever I'm not your
dad)

```
Plug 'zphixon/just-a-status-line'
```

additional (optional) git integration with [vim-gitgutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter)
and/or [fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive).

## todo

* ability to include user-defined bits
* cursor column probably
    * although this may fall under the above category
* test in vim8 and without gitgutter/fugitive
